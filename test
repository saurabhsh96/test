To calculate the EMI (Equated Monthly Installment), total interest paid, and total amount paid for a loan amount of ₹5,273,752, we will use the following formulas:

### Formula for EMI:
The formula for calculating EMI is:

\[
EMI = P \times \frac{r(1 + r)^n}{(1 + r)^n - 1}
\]

Where:
- \( P \) = Loan amount (₹5,273,752)
- \( r \) = Monthly interest rate (Annual interest rate divided by 12)
- \( n \) = Total number of months (91 months)

### Total amount paid:
The total amount paid is calculated by multiplying the EMI by the number of months.

### Total interest paid:
The total interest paid is the difference between the total amount paid and the principal amount.

### Steps to calculate:
1. Convert the annual interest rate to a monthly rate by dividing it by 12.
2. Calculate the EMI using the formula.
3. Calculate the total amount paid by multiplying the EMI by the total number of months.
4. Subtract the principal from the total amount paid to get the total interest paid.

Now let's write the code to calculate all these values:

```python
# Given values
principal = 5273752  # Loan amount in Rupees
annual_rate = 10.65  # Annual interest rate in percentage
months = 91  # Loan tenure in months

# Convert annual rate to monthly rate (percentage to decimal)
monthly_rate = (annual_rate / 100) / 12

# Calculate EMI using the formula
EMI = principal * (monthly_rate * (1 + monthly_rate)**months) / ((1 + monthly_rate)**months - 1)

# Calculate the total amount paid
total_paid = EMI * months

# Calculate the total interest paid
total_interest = total_paid - principal

# Output the results
print(f"EMI: ₹{EMI:.2f}")
print(f"Total Amount Paid: ₹{total_paid:.2f}")
print(f"Total Interest Paid: ₹{total_interest:.2f}")
```

### Explanation:
- The monthly rate is the annual rate divided by 12 and converted into a decimal.
- The EMI is calculated using the formula mentioned.
- The total amount paid is obtained by multiplying the EMI by the number of months.
- The total interest is the difference between the total paid amount and the principal.

### Example Output:
Running this code will provide the EMI, the total amount paid, and the total interest paid.

Would you like me to run this code and show you the output?


The formula for calculating **interest** on a loan, without needing to calculate the monthly EMI, depends on whether the interest is **simple** or **compound**. In your case, with the given annual rate, it seems you're asking about **compound interest** since you are also calculating the EMI.

### Formula for Compound Interest (CI):
The formula to calculate the total compound interest on a loan is:

\[
A = P \times \left(1 + \frac{r}{100}\right)^n
\]

Where:
- \(A\) = Total amount after interest (principal + interest)
- \(P\) = Principal loan amount
- \(r\) = Annual interest rate
- \(n\) = Number of years (loan tenure in years)

To calculate the **interest** alone, you subtract the principal from the total amount:

\[
\text{Interest} = A - P
\]

Where:
- \( A = P \times \left(1 + \frac{r}{100}\right)^{\frac{n}{12}} \) (for monthly interest calculation)
- \( \text{Interest} = A - P \)

### Key Notes:
- For **monthly** calculation of compound interest, the formula can be adjusted for monthly compounding periods by dividing the annual rate by 12 and using months instead of years.

Would you like me to calculate the interest using this formula for the loan of ₹5,273,752 over 91 months with an annual rate of 10.65%?

To include the compound interest formula separately in the code and calculate the interest, let's break down the steps and integrate them into the same script. 

### Revised Code:
We will calculate the interest using the compound interest formula separately from the EMI calculation, and display both values.

Here’s the updated code:

```python
# Given values
principal = 5273752  # Loan amount in Rupees
annual_rate = 10.65  # Annual interest rate in percentage
months = 91  # Loan tenure in months

# Convert annual rate to monthly rate (percentage to decimal)
monthly_rate = (annual_rate / 100) / 12

# Calculate EMI using the EMI formula
EMI = principal * (monthly_rate * (1 + monthly_rate)**months) / ((1 + monthly_rate)**months - 1)

# Calculate the total amount paid
total_paid = EMI * months

# Calculate the total interest paid using the formula for EMI-based interest
total_interest_emi = total_paid - principal

# ---- Compound Interest Calculation ----
# Convert loan tenure in months to years for compound interest formula
loan_years = months / 12

# Compound interest formula for total amount A
A = principal * (1 + (annual_rate / 100))**loan_years

# Calculate compound interest
compound_interest = A - principal

# Output the results
print(f"EMI: ₹{EMI:.2f}")
print(f"Total Amount Paid (with EMI): ₹{total_paid:.2f}")
print(f"Total Interest Paid (with EMI): ₹{total_interest_emi:.2f}")
print(f"Total Compound Interest: ₹{compound_interest:.2f}")
```

### Explanation:
- **EMI Calculation**: This part is the same as before, where the EMI is calculated using the formula for monthly payments.
- **Compound Interest Calculation**:
  - The total amount \( A \) after compound interest is calculated using the formula:  
    \[
    A = P \times \left(1 + \frac{r}{100}\right)^n
    \]
  - Here, \( n \) is the tenure in years, so we convert the number of months to years by dividing by 12.
  - The compound interest is then simply the difference between the total amount \( A \) and the principal.
  
### Output Example:
Running this code will display:
- The EMI amount
- The total amount paid (EMI × number of months)
- The total interest paid using the EMI formula
- The total compound interest (using the compound interest formula)

Would you like me to explain the results in more detail or calculate with different inputs?

Great question! The reason the **interest** calculated using the **compound interest formula** is different from the interest calculated through the **EMI formula** lies in the nature of how each method calculates interest and how the repayments are structured.

### Key Differences Between the Two:

1. **EMI-Based Interest Calculation**:
   - In the **EMI method**, the interest is calculated based on the principal amount and is applied across a fixed monthly payment plan. The interest is compounded monthly (in most cases), but because you're making payments regularly, the interest calculation also accounts for the fact that the loan balance decreases over time with each payment.
   - As a result, the total interest calculated through the EMI formula reflects not only the interest applied to the principal but also the reduction in the outstanding loan balance as you make monthly payments.

2. **Compound Interest Formula**:
   - The **compound interest formula** calculates interest **on the principal alone**, and assumes no repayments are made throughout the loan period. The interest is **compounded over time**, but **there's no reduction in the principal** due to repayments. In this case, the total amount after interest is calculated by applying the interest rate to the entire principal over the loan term.
   - This means that the compound interest calculation gives a higher value for interest because it assumes the full principal remains unpaid, growing with interest over time.

### Why the Interest Differs:
- The **EMI interest** is calculated based on the actual reduction in the principal (because monthly payments reduce the outstanding loan balance). As you continue to pay off the loan, less interest is charged on the remaining balance. Thus, the total interest paid is lower than what you'd get by simply applying the compound interest formula to the entire principal.
  
- The **compound interest formula** assumes that no payments are made, so the principal remains the same, and interest is charged on the full amount throughout the entire loan term.

### Example to Illustrate:

Let’s walk through an example to clarify the difference:

#### Loan Details:
- **Principal (P)**: ₹5,273,752
- **Annual Interest Rate (r)**: 10.65%
- **Loan Tenure**: 91 months (7.58 years)

#### **1. Compound Interest Calculation**:
For compound interest, we use the formula:

\[
A = P \times \left(1 + \frac{r}{100}\right)^{\frac{n}{12}}
\]

Where:
- \(A\) is the final amount (principal + interest),
- \(n\) is the number of months (in years: \(n/12\)).

So, in your case, the total compound interest after 91 months will be calculated based on the entire principal growing over time at 10.65% annually without any reductions from repayments.

#### **2. EMI Calculation**:
For EMI, each monthly payment partially goes toward interest and partially goes toward reducing the principal. Early payments have a larger interest component, and later payments have a larger principal repayment component. As a result, the total interest over the term is less than the compound interest because of the ongoing reduction in principal.

---

### How the Interest Is Different:

- **Compound Interest** (CI) assumes that the principal is growing with interest continuously over the loan term without any repayments.
  
- **EMI Interest** reflects the fact that payments are made periodically, which reduces the principal. As a result, the total interest paid is lower than compound interest because the loan balance is continuously decreasing, and less interest is applied to the remaining balance.

---

### Summary:

- **EMI interest** is lower than compound interest because it accounts for the fact that the principal reduces each month due to repayments.
- **Compound interest** assumes the full principal amount is left unpaid, so it accumulates interest on the whole amount throughout the term.

In a nutshell, **EMI-based interest** is more reflective of a real-world loan where you make payments, while **compound interest** reflects a theoretical scenario where the loan is allowed to grow without payments.
